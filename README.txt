Basic page-rank program that uses an iterative and an algebraic method to compute the probability vector.
It uses formulas from the following web page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank.

It reads from an input file the number N, followed by N neighbour lists, the probability d and eps(the error).

This is how it's used:
  -  Iterative(input_file, d, eps)
  -  Algebraic(input_file, d)
